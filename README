**magiclantern converter mlv/raw to dng**

starting 2013 i tried to code an all-in-one-without-install-lightweight-application for converting raw/mlv-files to cinema dng.

with 1.5.0 i recoded most and changed to wpf to deliver simpler and more beautiful gui. mainly it does not use other applications and/or code-parts. the decision to go free was after dialog with a1ex and primarly to implement vertical banding and chroma smoothing. both was coded already by a1ex from the magiclantern-team.
***
the application, thus the sourcecode, is under GPL-License.
